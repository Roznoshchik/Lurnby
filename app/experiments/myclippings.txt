There are eras of human history in which the channels of thought have been too deeply cut and no change was possible, and nothing new ever happened, and “best” was a matter of dogma, but that is not the situation now. Now the stream of our common consciousness seems to be obliterating its own banks, losing its central direction and purpose, flooding the lowlands, disconnecting and isolating the highlands and to no particular purpose other than the wasteful fulfillment of its own internal momentum. Some channel deepening seems called for.

MongoDB includes a function called findAndModify, which handles searching and updating in a single function. This adds an extra layer of security because it ensures the update happens immediately when a record is found, rather than adding round-trip time to process the record on the client side and save it back to the database, during which time someone else might change the record and cause the concurrent access problem described earlier.

One thing that happens when you start to really play with Node.js is you think of JavaScript in terms of I/O interactions. The initialize function is a shining example of the callback flow; it’s easy to try to read the file as a whole and get lost in layers of callbacks and functions, but when we write our code like in Example 6-3 , it makes the programmer’s intent clear.

By the time the request comes through to your callback method, it contains more than just the web browser’s message — it contains everything the server knows about that message. Express’s session middleware is part of the server’s understanding of the request; the web browser sends an identifier, which the server uses to read the user’s session data from the memory store (described later in this chapter). The nice part about this is it’s done under the covers so you can just access the results of that read through the session variable attached to the request object.

Have rabbits and flowers discovered some secret formula for finding primes? Not exactly. They like 89 not because it is prime, but because it is one of nature’s other favourite numbers: the Fibonacci numbers.

Actually these numbers shouldn’t be named after Fibonacci at all, because he was not the first to stumble across them. In fact they weren’t discovered by mathematicians at all, but by poets and musicians in medieval India. Indian poets and musicians were keen to explore all the possible rhythmic structures you can generate by using combinations of short and long rhythmic units. If a long sound is twice the length of a short sound, then how many different patterns are there with a set number of beats? For example, with eight beats you could do four long sounds or eight short ones. But there are lots of combinations between these two extremes.

A classical understanding sees the world primarily as underlying form itself. A romantic understanding sees it primarily in terms of immediate appearance. If you were to show an engine or a mechanical drawing or electronic schematic to a romantic it is unlikely he would see much of interest in it. It has no appeal because the reality he sees is its surface. Dull, complex lists of names, lines and numbers. Nothing interesting. But if you were to show the same blueprint or schematic or give the same description to a classical person he might look at it and then become fascinated by it because he sees that within the lines and shapes and symbols is a tremendous richness of underlying form.

I’m just as happy to be thinking about the rational, analytical, classical world of Phaedrus. His kind of rationality has been used since antiquity to remove oneself from the tedium and depression of one’s immediate surroundings. What makes it hard to see is that where once it was used to get away from it all, the escape has been so successful that now it is the “it all” that the romantics are trying to escape. What makes his world so hard to see clearly is not its strangeness but its usualness. Familiarity can blind you too.

According to mainstream academic Western science, the history of the universe is the history of developing matter. Life, consciousness, and intelligence are more or less accidental and insignificant side products of this development.

Although religious activities are generally permitted, or even formally encouraged, from a strictly scientific point of view any involvement in spirituality appears to be and is interpreted as an irrational activity indicating emotional and intellectual immaturity --lack of education, primitive superstition, and regression to magical and infantile thinking. Direct experiences of spiritual realities are seen as manifestations of a serious mental disease, psychosis. Religion, bereft of its experiential component has largely lost the connection to its deep spiritual source and as a result of it has become empty, meaningless, and increasingly irrelevant in our life. In this form, it cannot compete with the persuasiveness of materialistic science backed up by its technological triumphs.

Under these circumstances, religion has ceased to be a vital force during our life, as well as at the time of dying and death. Its references to life after death, the posthumous adventures of the soul, and the abodes of the Beyond, such as heaven and hell, have been relegated to the realm of fairy tales and handbooks of psychiatry. The entire spiritual history of humanity has been pathologized. At the cradle of all the great religions of the world were transpersonal experiences of their founders, prophets, and saints.

People dying in Western societies also often lack effective human support that would ease their transition. We try to protect ourselves from the emotional discomfort that death induces. The industrial world tends to remove sick and dying people into hospitals and nursing homes. The emphasis is on life-support systems and mechanical prolongation of life, often beyond any reasonable limits, rather than the quality of the human environment.

non-ordinary states of consciousness or, more specifically, an important sub-category of them that I call “holotropic.” This composite word literally means “oriented toward wholeness” or “moving in the direction of wholeness” (from the Greek holos, whole, and trepein, moving toward or in the direction of something). This term suggests that in our everyday state of consciousness we identify with only a small fraction of who we really are. The best way of explaining what holotropic means is to refer to the Hindu distinction between namarupa (the name and shape that we have in our everyday existence) and Atman-Brahman (our deepest identity, which is commensurate with the cosmic creative principle). In holotropic states of consciousness, we can transcend the narrow boundaries of the body ego and reclaim our full identity. We can experientially identify with anything that is part of creation and even with the creative principle itself.

It describes the time of death as a unique opportunity for spiritual liberation from the cycles of death and rebirth and a period that determines our next incarnation, if we do not achieve liberation. In this context, it is possible to see the intermediate state between lives (bardo) as being in a way more important than incarnate existence. It is then essential to prepare for this time by systematic practice during our lifetime.

The experiences involved seem to transcend race and culture and originate in the collective unconscious as described by C.G.Jung. It is possible to spend one's entire lifetime without ever experiencing these realms or even without being aware of their existence, until one is catapulted into them at the time of biological death. However, for some people this experiential area becomes available during their lifetime in a variety of situations including psychedelic sessions or some other powerful forms of self-exploration, serious spiritual practice, participation in shamanic rituals, or during spontaneous psycho-spiritual crises. This opens up for them the possibility of experiential exploration of these territories of the psyche on their own terms so that the encounter with death does not come as a complete surprise when it is imposed on them at the time of biological demise.

This "dying before dying" has two important consequences: it liberates the individual from the fear of death and changes his or her attitude toward it, as well as influences the actual experience of dying at the time of the biological demise. However, this elimination of the fear of death, also transforms the individual's way of being in the world. For this reason, there is no fundamental difference between the preparation for death and the practice of dying, on the one hand, and spiritual practice leading to enlightenment, on the other. This is the reason why the ancient books of the dead could be used in both situations.
