  {"text": "Donald Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at his rallies, calling her Pochahontas to cast doubt on her Native American Heritage. Trump even referred to Warren as Pocahontas at a November 2017 White House event honoring Navajo code-breakers. At a rally in Montana this past July, Trump offered Sen. Warren $1 million if she took a DNA test to prove her heritage. Trump spoke of bringing a DNA test to a debate if she challenges him."},
  {"text": "“We will take that little kit — but we have to do it gently. Because we’re in the #MeToo generation, we have to do it gently,” Trump said. “And we will very gently take that kit, and slowly toss it, hoping it doesn’t injure her arm, and we will say: I will give you a million dollars to your favorite charity, paid for by Trump, if you take the test and it shows you’re an Indian. I have a feeling she will say no.”"},

She's also one of the biggest arseholes on Twitter. At night, she can be found drinking Conservative tears while pulling off the wings of flies just because she can. She is the founder of a Marxist, Commie, Maoist, Socialist site and has contributed to several other sites, blah blah blah. She is an awful person but she doesn't like to brag about that."}
